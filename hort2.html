"Okay, Okay, I have a 'Hort activity!" said <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span>.  "I tried this with my family on Zoom <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERIOD OF TIME"></span> ago, and it worked really well.  Let's try to play Charades."  First, everyone needs to think of a <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> idea and write it down on a piece of <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>.  Then, we'll take all of the ideas and distribute them to each other.  I think that <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> will be particularly good at this.  I've seen her act before, and she does a mean <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>.  Okay... I got a really <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> one... I'm supposed to act out a <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> being chased by a <span class="input" data-placeholder="ANIMAL"></span>?  <span class="input" data-placeholder="EXCLAMATION"></span>!  This is going to be tough!  Well at least it isn't as bad as the last time we played Charades.  That time, nobody could guess what <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> was acting out.  She __VERB, PAST TENSE__ while <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN ING"></span> her __PART OF THE BODY and we just stared at her <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADVERB"></span>.  It turns out, she was trying to act out her favorite TV show, The Real <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span> of <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLACE"></span>!  We were never going to get that one.  Alright, well, it's almost my turn.  I'll let you go while I practice my miming skills.  I am determined to make this a <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> game of Charades!  Here goes nothing!
