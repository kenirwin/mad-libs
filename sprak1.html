One of the joys of Spraksgiving is that it follows some <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> patterns. As dictated by tradition, the <span class="input" data-placeholder="room in house"></span> runs according to an itinerary written in <span class="input" data-placeholder="sprak name #1"></span>’s hand way back during the <span class="input" data-placeholder="a US President"></span> administration.  

The proceedings begin at 2pm sharp when <span class="input" data-placeholder="sprak name #2"></span> begins to <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb"></span>the turkey, including the must-have ingredients <span class="input" data-placeholder="seasoning"></span> and <span class="input" data-placeholder="seasoning"></span>. Every <span class="input" data-placeholder="number"></span> minutes, another task awaits, and another <span class="input" data-placeholder="profession"></span> steps in to tend to it. With so many people working, it’s important to <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb"></span> utensils after using so you don’t chop <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span> on the same surface that just got used for <span class="input" data-placeholder="food"></span>. That happened back in aught-<span class="input" data-placeholder="number 1-9"></span> and we’ve never forgotten.

<span class="input" data-placeholder="sprak name #3"></span> has some ideas for shaking up the patterns, though.  <span class="input" data-placeholder="sprak name #3 (again)"></span> has been watching the <span class="input" data-placeholder="celebrity name"></span> cooking show, and cannot wait to try a new way to <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb"></span> the turkey and <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb"></span> the potatoes.  <span class="input" data-placeholder="sprak name #3 (again again)"></span> even has ideas for making a <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective ending in -y"></span> Crumble that is to die for!
