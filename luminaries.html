<p>Congratulations to our two <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> Luminaries. While Mero is completing his first year in the program, Hal is a Luminaries veteran, having completed <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> years in the program. Both have made <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> contributions to our library.</p>

<p>For example, Mero explored the <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> world of photogrammetry. Some of you may not know what photogrammetry is. It involves taking <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> photos of an object to <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADVERB"></span> generate a digital model. Mero created models of a <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>, a <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>, and a <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>_. How industrious! </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hal devoted his time and <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> talents to reading license agreements and <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN -ING"></span> a program to deactivate overdue <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span>.</p>

<p>It wasn't all work, though. Hal and Mero got on <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADVERB"></span>. We could often hear them <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN -ING"></span> in the office, talking about the goings-on in <span class="input" data-placeholder="CAMPUS BUILDING"></span> or sharing a laugh over heuristic <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span>. </p>
