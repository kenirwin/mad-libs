It's New Years Eve, and what a/n <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> of year it has been!  We are gathered around the firepit at <span class="input" data-placeholder="LOCATION"></span>, 
making sure to keep ourselves <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> feet apart, as <span class="input" data-placeholder="FAMOUS PERSON'S NAME"></span> has instructed us do.  This year has indeed been memorable. We have all taken up new hobbies to cope with COVID-<span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span>. <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> started crocheting <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span> this year, and has brought for everyone who is gathered today.  They are so <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span>!  <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> has been baking <span class="input" data-placeholder="TYPE OF FOOD"></span>, in the shape of <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span>.   We thought we might try some of their creations tonight with our hot <span class="input" data-placeholder="LIQUID"></span>.  YUM.  <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> decide to try their hand at <span class="input" data-placeholder="TYPE OF ANIMAL"></span>-keeping.  We hear it's going <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADVERB"></span>.  And have you heard of <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span>'s new exercise routine?  They have been <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN ING"></span> <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> miles per day and claim to be in the best shape of their life!  What a year.  Lastly, <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> claims to have coped with the pandemic by binge-watching television.  In fact, they are so <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> about television, that they've started a podcast to compare and contrast their favorite TV shows, The Real Housewives of <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLACE"></span> and <span class="input" data-placeholder="TELEVISION SHOW"></span>.  I'm sure that podcast is incredible <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span>!  Well, even though we've learned some new things this year, we still think it has been a <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> of a year, and we would like to throw it in the <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>.  We are hoping that next year will be better.
