Well, we've made it halfway across the country. Only another <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> miles to go on our road trip. And what a/n <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> trip it has been. 

We've already had a few adventures. We started off by visiting <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> who took us to their favorite national park, the <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> Canyon. It was <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span>. On the way home, traffic came to a complete standstill when a herd of <span class="input" data-placeholder="KIND OF ANIMAL (PLURAL)"></span> crossed the road right in front of us. All we could do was wait <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADVERB"></span> until they <span class="input" data-placeholder="PAST TENSE VERB"></span> away.

After that, things were going well until day number <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> of driving, when we stopped at a rest stop to stretch our <span class="input" data-placeholder="BODY PART (PLURAL)"></span> and ended up <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN -ING"></span> into a patch of stinging <span class="input" data-placeholder="KIND OF PLANT (PLURAL)"></span>.  Thankfully the swelling went down after we applied some  <span class="input" data-placeholder="LIQUID"></span> to the rash. 

Up next, we plan to visit one of Betsy's bucket-list locations, the World Largest Ball of <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span> in <span class="input" data-placeholder="LOCATION"></span>. She is so excited she's been <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN -ING"></span> off the walls. We've been passing signs for it for the past <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> miles.

As exciting as that sounds, though, Ken is really looking forward to lunch. He has his <span class="input" data-placeholder="PART OF THE BODY"></span> on a hamburger at a <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> new gastropub where they advertise using <span class="input" data-placeholder="FOOD ITEM (PLURAL)"></span> in place of buns. Tasty and gluten-free! 

Who knows what other <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> adventures we'll have along the way?
