Re: Per My Last Email<br />
To:  <span class="input" data-placeholder="reality TV star"></span>,


Thank you so much for your <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> response to my last email. I apologize for the <span class="input" data-placeholder="rage noise"></span> you are clearly experiencing about <span class="product you would be embarrassed to be seen buying by your boss"></span> Inc. policy at this time. I take full responsibility, as I should have known that personally making <span class="input" data-placeholder="number"></span> hours’ worth of training videos, a(n) <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> flow chart describing operations, and putting an increasingly elaborate series of <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span> on your desk would be insufficient guidance. 

As a reminder, based on current regulations by the great state of <span class="input" data-placeholder="fantasy land "></span> we are prohibited from <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb ending in -ing"></span> into <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span>. I recognized that this policy causes some inconvenience, as our <span class="input" data-placeholder="group of people"></span> has a long standing tradition of <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb ending in -ing"></span> and <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb ending in -ing"></span>. 

While I understand that change is difficult, unfortunately these behaviors have contributed to significant damage to our organizations’ <span class="input" data-placeholder="number"></span> <span class="input" data-placeholder="parts of the body"></span>.

I hate to be the <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> guy here, but it’s my job to look out for this company’s interests, and sometimes I need to make some <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span> and crack some <span class="input" data-placeholder="parts of the body"></span> for that to happen. Do I wish I could be one of the <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span> and get invited to the staff <span class="input" data-placeholder="worst holiday"></span> party like everyone else? Not really. I actually don’t like you all, and I appreciate my alone time you <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span>   <span class="input" data-placeholder="circus performers"></span>.

I hope that you’ve noticed that I cced our Executive Director, <span class="input" data-placeholder="90s Pop Star"></span> I think at this time in our company’s history, personal accountability and <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span> are crucial to our success.

<span class="input" data-placeholder="bad word"></span> you.

Sincerely,</br>
Associate Director <span class="input" data-placeholder="famous animal"></span>
