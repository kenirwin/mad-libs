    Re: Per My Last Email<br />
    To:  {{ 'reality TV star' | mad_lib }},
</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your {{ 'adjective' | mad_lib }} response to my last email. I apologize for the 
    {{ 'rage noise' | mad_lib }} you are clearly experiencing about {{ "product you’d be embarrassed to be seen buying by your boss" | mad_lib }} Inc. policy at this time. I take full responsibility, as I should have known that personally making {{ 'number' | mad_lib }} hours’ worth of training 
    videos, a(n) {{ 'adjective' | mad_lib }} flow chart describing operations, and putting an increasingly elaborate series of {{ 'plural noun' | mad_lib }} on your desk would be insufficient guidance. 
</p>
<p>
	As a reminder, based on current regulations by the great state of {{ 'fantasy land ' | mad_lib }} we are prohibited from {{ 'verb ending in -ing' | mad_lib }} into {{ 'plural noun' | mad_lib}}. I recognized that this policy causes some inconvenience, as our {{ 'group of people' | mad_lib}} has a long standing tradition of {{ 'verb ending in -ing' | mad_lib }} and {{ 'verb ending in -ing' | mad_lib }}. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
    While I understand that change is difficult, unfortunately these behaviors have contributed to 
    significant damage to our organizations’ {{ 'number' | mad_lib }} {{ 'parts of the body' | mad_lib }}.
</p>

	<p>I hate to be the {{ 'adjective' | mad_lib }} guy here, but it’s my job to look out for this company’s interests, and sometimes I need to make some {{ 'plural noun' | mad_lib }} and crack some {{ 'parts of the body' | mad_lib }} for that to happen. Do I wish I could be one of the {{ 'plural noun' | mad_lib }} and get invited to the staff {{ 'worst holiday' | mad_lib }} party like everyone else? Not really. I actually don’t like you all, and I appreciate my alone time you {{ 'adjective' | mad_lib }}   {{ 'circus performers' | mad_lib }}.
</p>
<p>
	I hope that you’ve noticed that I cced our Executive Director, {{ '90s Pop Star' | mad_lib }} I think at this time in our company’s history, personal accountability and {{ 'noun' | mad_lib }} are crucial to our success.
</p>

<p>
    {{ 'bad word' | mad_lib }} you.
</p>

<p>
    Sincerely,</br>
    Associate Director {{ 'famous animal' | mad_lib }}
</p>
