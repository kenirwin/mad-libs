Happy birthday to Esther, the most <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> girl we know! She may be thirteen years old, but I think we can all agree that she doesn't look a day over 
<span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span>.

In celebration of Esther, we'd like to share some <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> facts about this amazing person.

<ol>
    <li>
        Esther loves to dance. You may catch her practicing some <span class="input" data-placeholder="TYPE OF DANCE"></span> moves out on the floor tonight. Keep an eye out for her <i>gran jet&eacute;</i> or a kick-ball-<span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB"></span>.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you ever get lost in the woods, Esther might have the skills to help you out. As a <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> Girl Scout, she can light a fire by rubbing two <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span> together. And she can catch a fish with her bare <span class="input" data-placeholder="PART OF THE BODY"></span>. What a multi-talented person!
    </li>

    <li>
        She is a <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> reader. You might not know this, but Esther once read <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> books in a single day.
    </li>

    <li>
        One of Esther's least favorite things is her school uniform, <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADVERB"></span> known as SMOD. SMOD stands for <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE STARTING WITH 'S'"></span> Mode Of Dress. It is truly the worst.
    </li>

    <li>
        Esther has been taking acting classes. Perhaps you'll see her in an upcoming production of <i>Little Red Riding <span class="input" data-placeholder="ARTICLE OF CLOTHING"></span></i>, <i>The Importance of Being <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span></i>, or <i>The <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> of the Opera</i>. We predict that she'll be a star.
    </li>
</ol>
