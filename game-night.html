It's game night, folks, and Sally and Ryan are hosting!  We are all so excited for the occasion that
we are virtually <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN ING"></span> from our <span class="input" data-placeholder="PIECE OF FURNITURE, PL"></span>.  It looks like a pretty big crowd
out there in the stratosphere.  I see <span class="input" data-placeholder="NAME"></span> tuning in from <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLACE"></span>, and it looks like <span class="input" data-placeholder="NAME"></span> is at home in 
Cincinnati, but strangely tuning in from <span class="input" data-placeholder="ROOM IN HOUSE"></span>.  Well... at least we've made it here in one way or 
another.  Sally and Ryan have planned the first game.  They made it up themselves, and named it <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>.  They've explained the <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> rules to us, and it goes something like this.  First, someone names an object, like a <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>.  Then we all must go <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB"></span> it from our own homes, and the first one to find it shouts "I <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN ING"></span> did it!!!"  We think it's going to be a great game.  Oh hey!  <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON"></span> brought snacks!  It's making us all hungry... pandemic potlucks are just NOT the same.  Uh oh... no.. <span class="input" data-placeholder="SAME PERSON"></span> don't worry, we can wait to try your snacks post-pandemic... no, no... YIKES!  They just <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB, PAST TENSE"></span> the snacks right into the computer screen!  Sometimes isolation makes us a little <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> but we're trying to hold it together, the best we can.  Well folks, we're off to an interesting start here, and I suspect the rest of the night will be just <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span>.
