Welcome to Crafternoon! My name is Elise, and I will be your <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> Craftmaster for today. What is Crafternoon, you ask? Well, here's how it works. First, you go to your <span class="input" data-placeholder="room in house"></span> and gather up all of your <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span> and <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span>. Then, you sit down at the kitchen <span class="input" data-placeholder="piece of furniture"></span> and start putting everything together. You might need to <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb"></span> for a little while, say, <span class="input" data-placeholder="number"></span> minutes until you have a <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> idea. My personal favorite craft is when you glue together <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span> with <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span> ! Oh look! Do you see what <span class="input" data-placeholder="person in room"></span> is making? Wow! They have really gotten creative by using popsicle sticks to make a <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span> ! <span class="input" data-placeholder="person in room"></span> is also getting into the spirit by making ornaments out of <span class="input" data-placeholder="plural noun"></span>. I am sure those will look lovely on their <span class="input" data-placeholder="holiday"></span> tree. I think <span class="input" data-placeholder="person in room"></span> may have gotten a little off track, though, it looks like they glued their <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span> to their <span class="input" data-placeholder="part of the body"></span>. Oh well... I'm sure they'll figure that out. Well, we are off to a <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> start, folks. Thanks for bringing yourselves and your <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> hearts to this Crafternoon today!
