“Well Everyone,” says Grampy, this year we’ve decided to have Grampy’s <span class="input" data-placeholder="food"></span> instead of turkey for Thanksgiving….. “JUST KIDDING!”  Grampy goes into the <span class="input" data-placeholder="room in the house"></span> and pulls out the turkey.  “Here is our <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> turkey!  Grammy made it extra <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> this year, because she added a secret ingredient.  “What is it?,” ask Brady and Morgan.  “Well,” said Grammy, “when I looked at this <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> turkey, I just knew that it needed some <span class="input" data-placeholder="food"></span>.  I learned how to make it that way when I lived in <span class="input" data-placeholder="place"></span>.  And you know what else?” Grammy said.  “We named this turkey after our most finely feathered family member, <span class="input" data-placeholder="person in the room"></span>!  “Ha!”  Said Brady- I knew it!  <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> Brady went on to <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb"></span> with <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> Morgan in the <span class="input" data-placeholder="room in the house"></span>.  Meanwhile, Chris and Jenny poured some <span class="input" data-placeholder="liquid"></span> into a glass and said, “It’s just another <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> day in the Lehman Household!  Happy Thanksgiving!”
