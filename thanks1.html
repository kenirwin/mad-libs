It’s Thanksgiving Day!  Can you believe it?  It’s only <span class="input" data-placeholder="number"></span> o-clock and people are already in the kitchen bustling about.  <span class="input" data-placeholder="person in the room"></span>  just started sautéing the <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span> and the house starting to smell like <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span>.   <span class="input" data-placeholder="another person in the room"></span> just <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb (past tense)"></span> into the kitchen, and is wearing a Thanksgiving <span class="input" data-placeholder="article of clothing"></span>.  It looks like everyone is in the spirit of the day!  Ooh- did you see that?  <span class="input" data-placeholder="another person in the room"></span> just dipped his/her <span class="input" data-placeholder="part of the body"></span> into the <span class="input" data-placeholder="food"></span> for quality control!  YUM, it tastes just like <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span>!  It looks like it’s time to <span class="input" data-placeholder="verb"></span> the table for our <span class="input" data-placeholder="adjective"></span> dinner.  Oh No!!  We forgot to pick up rosemary for the <span class="input" data-placeholder="food"></span>.  It looks like we’ll have to go to the <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span> store to pick it up.  What a <span class="input" data-placeholder="noun"></span> of a morning!!
