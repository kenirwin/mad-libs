<span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> years ago in the <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> state of <span class="input" data-placeholder="STATE"></span>, Ken and Betsy met at a <span class="input" data-placeholder="TYPE OF DANCE"></span> dance weekend. 

On the first Friday night, Betsy was <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN -ING"></span> up a storm when she saw this <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> man <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN -ING"></span> into the room.

“<span class="input" data-placeholder="EXCLAMATION"></span>! Who is that <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> lookin' man?” she thought.

She felt her <span class="input" data-placeholder="PART OF THE BODY"></span> pounding. 

Just as she was regaining her composure, Ken <span class="input" data-placeholder="PAST TENSE VERB"></span> right up to her and asked her to <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB"></span> with him. 

“Oh my <span class="input" data-placeholder="DEITY"></span>,” she thought. “<span class="input" data-placeholder="EXPRESSIONG OF EMPHATIC AGREEMENT"></span>_!” 

They looked mighty <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> as they <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADVERB"></span> danced across the <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>.

It felt like they were <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> miles away in their own little <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>. 

From that weekend on, Ken only looked at Betsy with <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUNS"></span> in his eyes, and Betsy thought Ken was the cat's <span class="input" data-placeholder="ANIMAL SOUND"></span>. Their worlds were forever changed.
