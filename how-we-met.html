__NUMBER__ years ago in the __ADJECTIVE__ state of __STATE__, Ken and Betsy met at a __TYPE OF DANCE__ dance weekend. 

On the first Friday night, Betsy was __VERB ENDING IN -ING__ up a storm when she saw this __ADJECTIVE__ man __VERB ENDING IN -ING__ into the room.

“__EXCLAMATION__! Who is that __ADJECTIVE__ lookin' man?” she thought.

She felt her __PART OF THE BODY__ pounding. 

Just as she was regaining her composure, Ken __PAST TENSE VERB__ right up to her and asked her to __VERB__ with him. 

“Oh my __DEITY__,” she thought. “__EXPRESSIONG OF EMPHATIC AGREEMENT___!” 

They looked mighty __ADJECTIVE__ as they __ADVERB__ danced across the __NOUN__.

It felt like they were __NUMBER__ miles away in their own little __NOUN__. 

From that weekend on, Ken only looked at Betsy with __PLURAL NOUNS__ in his eyes, and Betsy thought Ken was the cat's __ANIMAL SOUND__. Their worlds were forever changed.
