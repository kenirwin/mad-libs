"Santa to North Pole, who's next on my list?"  "North Pole to Santa, Your next drop off location is at the Lehman's House on Ridgewood Rd. Are you ready?" 

Santa pulled up his sleigh, led by <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> reindeer, and landed on the roof. "This looks like a(n) <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> chimney. I wonder if I'll fit through." Rudolph gave Santa a(n) <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> look and shoved him down the chimney. "Thanks Rudolph, my <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> steed!" When Santa looked around he couldn't believe what he saw. Brady and Morgan left him a plateful of <span class="input" data-placeholder="FOOD"></span> and a glass of <span class="input" data-placeholder="LIQUID"></span>. "What luck!" cried Santa. "There'll be an extra <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> under the tree for them in the morning!"

"Now it's time for the presents," thought Santa. "I've packed a <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> for Brady, and a remote-control <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> for Morgan. I hope they like them." 

All of a sudden, Santa heard a loud <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOISE"></span> coming from the roof. "What is that?" he thought. The noise got louder, and then he saw Rudolph's <span class="input" data-placeholder="PART OF THE BODY"></span> sticking through the ceiling. "Good thing they're moving," thought Santa. "No worries Rudolph, we'll just put a little <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> on that hole and they'll never notice."
