"Santa to North Pole, who's next on my list?"  "North Pole to Santa, Your next drop off location is at the Lehman's House on Ridgewood Rd. Are you ready?" 

Santa pulled up his sleigh, led by __NUMBER__ reindeer, and landed on the roof. "This looks like a(n) __ADJECTIVE__ chimney. I wonder if I'll fit through." Rudolph gave Santa a(n) __ADJECTIVE__ look and shoved him down the chimney. "Thanks Rudolph, my __ADJECTIVE__ steed!" When Santa looked around he couldn't believe what he saw. Brady and Morgan left him a plateful of __FOOD__ and a glass of __LIQUID__. "What luck!" cried Santa. "There'll be an extra __NOUN__ under the tree for them in the morning!"

"Now it's time for the presents," thought Santa. "I've packed a __NOUN__ for Brady, and a remote-control __NOUN__ for Morgan. I hope they like them." 

All of a sudden, Santa heard a loud __NOISE__ coming from the roof. "What is that?" he thought. The noise got louder, and then he saw Rudolph's __PART OF THE BODY__ sticking through the ceiling. "Good thing they're moving," thought Santa. "No worries Rudolph, we'll just put a little __NOUN__ on that hole and they'll never notice."
