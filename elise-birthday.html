Meet Elise, the <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> of <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLACENAME"></span>, Defender of <span class="input" data-placeholder="VIRTUE"></span>.

Alongside her trusty sidekick, Sir <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> Bones, she <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN -S"></span> the patriarchy, organizes crafternoons, and uproots invasive <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span>, all while maintaining a(n) <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> sense of style. 

Who is this person? Is she myth? Is she legend? Nope. Just your not-so-average <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> psychologist. Armed with a <i>DSM-V</i> in one hand and a <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> in the other, Elise <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENGING IN -S"></span> trouble wherever it is found. 

Why, just yesterday, Elise was watching <i>Married at <span class="input" data-placeholder="ORDINAL NUMBER"></span> Sight</i>, when Sir Bonesy-Bones alerted her to a disturbance in the Force. She grabbed her knitting needles and her <span class="input" data-placeholder="ONE OF ELISES FAVORITE THINGS"></span> and raced to the <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> scene of the crime. There, right before her, a(n) <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> white dude in MAGA <span class="input" data-placeholder="ARTICLE OF CLOTHING"></span> was watering his honeysuckle and receiving the <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> he had ordered from Amazon. "I will knit this in the bud," she said. She whipped out her knitting needles and <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB ENDING IN -ED"></span> the yarn around him. While he was wrapped up in yarn, she invited <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> and <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> over to <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB"></span> native plants in his yard. Case closed. 

"Just another day as <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> badass," said Elise. "Meow," agreed Bones, as he licked his <span class="input" data-placeholder="PART OF THE BODY"></span>, and they walked home.
