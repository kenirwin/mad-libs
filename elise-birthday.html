Meet Elise, the <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> of <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLACENAME"></span>, Defender of <span class="input" data-placeholder="VIRTUE"></span>.

Alongside her trusty sidekick, Sir <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> Bones, she <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB"></span> the patriarchy, organizes crafternoons, and uprooting invasive <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLURAL NOUN"></span>, all while maintaining a(n) <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> sense of style. 

Who is this person? Is she myth? Is she legend? Nope. Just you not-so-average <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> psychologist. Armed with a DSM-V in hand and a <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span> in the other, Elise <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB"></span>

Why, just yesterday, Elise and Bonesy-Bones 

Elise is a big fan of her family.
