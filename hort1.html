Well folks, it's been a really <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> year, but we have made it to the holidays.  Hooray!  This year, things will be a little different though, due to the <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> presence of COVID-19.  We thought about quarantining for <span class="input" data-placeholder="AMOUNT OF TIME"></span> prior to getting together, and then planning to meet at <span class="input" data-placeholder="PLACE"></span>, but ultimately, we decided that the safest thing to do was to <span class="input" data-placeholder="VERB"></span> from home.  It turns out, though, that there are some advantages to meeting from home.  <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> is truly embracing the Zoom spirit with her <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> clothing.  We thought she was joking when she said she'd only be wearing her Christmas <span class="input" data-placeholder="ARTICLE OF CLOTHING"></span> and yet, here she is, in all her glory!  <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> has taken a different approach because it's a little cold in her house.  She is wearing <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> pairs of __ARTICLE OF CLOTHING, PLURAL__!  Well... at least we're all comfortable.  Oh!  It looks like <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> baked cookies!  She tried out a new recipe this year, instead of chocolate chips, she used pieces of <span class="input" data-placeholder="NOUN"></span>!  I'm sure it will be delicious.... <span class="input" data-placeholder="PERSON IN THE ROOM"></span> has already eaten <span class="input" data-placeholder="NUMBER"></span> cookies, and has crumbs all over her <span class="input" data-placeholder="PART OF THE BODY"></span>!  Well, now that we are comfortable and have eaten our <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> holiday foods, I think we are ready to get this gathering going.  I'm sure we will all have the same <span class="input" data-placeholder="ADJECTIVE"></span> time that we have every year, even though this year is a little different.
